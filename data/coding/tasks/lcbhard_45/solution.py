def tic_tac_toe_winner(grid: List[List[int]]) -> str:
    """ Play a modified tic-tac-toe game on a 3x3 grid where each cell has a value.
    
    Takahashi (first player) and Aoki (second player) take turns choosing white cells.
    When a player chooses a cell, they score the points in that cell and paint it their color
    (Takahashi: red, Aoki: blue).
    
    The game ends when:
    - A player gets 3 consecutive cells of their color (row/column/diagonal) - that player wins
    - All cells are painted - the player with higher total score wins
    
    Both players play optimally. The sum of all values in the grid is guaranteed to be odd.
    
    Args:
        grid: A 3x3 grid of integers representing cell values
        
    Returns:
        "Takahashi" if Takahashi wins, "Aoki" if Aoki wins
